"""
class containing the implementation of Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)
Robert C. Martin’s definition of the Dependency Inversion Principle consists of two parts:

1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
